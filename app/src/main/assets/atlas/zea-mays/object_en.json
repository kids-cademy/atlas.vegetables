Scientists can alter color and the size of kernels, improve nutritional value and develop varieties that are resistant to pests, herbicides and drought."},{"name":"Staple food in most countries","value":"Maize is staple food in most countries in the world. Maize is rich source of sugar, proteins, vitamins and minerals. Anyway, maize is inferior to other cereals in nutritional value.

Unlike the maize that is used in human diet, special types of maize are used for the preparation of animal food."},{"name":"Used for the production of ethanol","value":"Maize is used for the production of ethanol that is used as bio-fuel. Ethanol does not induce pollution of the air like conventional fuels."},{"name":"Maize crops help cleaning of the air","value":"One acre of corn eliminates 8 tons of carbon dioxide from the air. Because of that, corn is one of the most important plants when it comes to the cleaning of the air."},{"name":"Size depends on the species","value":"Size of a maize plant depends on the species.

Wild species may reach 12 meters in height."},{"name":"Male flowers are on the plant's top","value":"Male flowers are located on the top of the plant. They release miniature pollen that is easily spread by wind. Female flowers develop between the stem and leaves. They are tightly enveloped with leaves known as husk. Female reproductive organs (stigmas) form well known corn silk."},{"name":"Popcorn is made of maize","value":"Maize is mostly used in the form of kernels or flour.
