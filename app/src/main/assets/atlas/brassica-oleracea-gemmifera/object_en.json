{"index":4,"name":"brassica-oleracea-gemmifera","display":"Brussels sprout","definition":"The Brussels sprout is a member of the Gemmifera Group of cabbages, grown for its edible buds.","description":"<p>Brussels sprouts are a cultivar of cabbage grown for their edible small leafy green buds, which resemble miniature cabbages.</p><p>The plant has long, smooth and leathery leaves which can be green to purple in color and are arranged alternately on the stem. </p><p>The sprouts form at the base of each leaf, in a long, spiral stem. </p><p>The edible portion of the crop is the bud, typically 1.5 to 4.0 centimeters in diameter, which is a small cabbage-like head. </p><p>Most varieties have green sprouts, but red-leaved varieties have also been developed.</p><p>Brussels sprouts are high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, making them a nutritious addition to your diet. </p><p>They may also come with added health benefits, including the potential to reduce the risk of cancer, decrease inflammation and improve blood sugar control.</p><p>For breast cancer in particular, eating Brussels sprout might change the way estrogen is used in the body.</p><p>Brussels sprouts usually are eaten cooked, and the small young sprouts have a more delicate flavour than older ones. </p><p>The most common method of preparing Brussels sprouts for cooking begins with cutting the buds off the stalk. </p><p>Any surplus stem is cut away, and any loose surface leaves are peeled and discarded. </p><p>Once cut and cleaned, the buds are typically cooked by boiling, steaming, stir frying, grilling, slow cooking, or roasting. </p><p>To ensure even cooking throughout, buds of a similar size are usually chosen. </p><p>Some cooks make a single cut or a cross in the center of the stem to aid the penetration of heat.</p><p>Though commonly grown as annuals, Brussels sprouts are biennial plants and will produce yellow flowers with four petals if kept for two seasons. </p><p>Seeds are borne in silique fruits. </p><p>The plant requires a mild cool climate and is harmed by hot weather.</p><p>In its seedling stage and early development, the plant closely resembles the common cabbage.</p><p>From that, the main stem grows and the auxiliary buds along the stem develop into small heads (sprouts).</p><p>Once harvested, sprouts last 3 to 5 weeks under ideal near-freezing conditions before wilting and discoloring, and about half as long at refrigerator temperature.</p><p>Although native to the Mediterranean region with other cabbage species, Brussels sprouts first appeared in northern Europe during the 5th century.</p><p>Later, in the 13th century, sprouts started being cultivated near Brussels, from which they derived their name.</p><p>First recorded description of the Brussels sprouts dates to 1587.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/brassica-oleracea-gemmifera/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/vegetables/brassica-oleracea-gemmifera/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/brassica-oleracea-gemmifera/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/vegetables/brassica-oleracea-gemmifera/contextual.jpg","caption":"<p>Brussels sprouts grow in temperature ranges of 7 to 24 °C.
