{"index":3,"name":"brassica-oleracea-italica","display":"Broccoli","definition":"Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family whose large flowering head and stalk is eaten as a vegetable.","description":"<p>The word broccoli comes from the Italian plural of broccolo, which means the flowering crest of a cabbage.</p><p>Broccoli, Brassica oleracea, variety italica, form of cabbage, of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), grown for its edible flower buds and stalk. </p><p>Broccoli has large flower heads, usually dark green in color, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick stalk which is usually light green.</p><p>The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves.</p><p>Broccoli resembles cauliflower, which is a different cultivar group of the same Brassica species.</p><p>Broccoli and cauliflower have been crossbred to produce brocciflower.</p><p>High in dietary fibre and a number of vitamins and minerals, including potassium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K, broccoli is a nutritious vegetable and can be eaten fresh or cooked. </p><p>Fresh broccoli should be dark green in colour, with firm stalks and compact bud clusters.</p><p>The flower clusters and stalk are usually boiled or steamed, but they may be eaten raw.</p><p>Broccoli is a cool weather crop that does poorly in hot summer weather. </p><p>It is a fast growing annual plant that grows between 60 and 90 centimeters tall. </p><p>Upright and branching with leathery leaves, broccoli bears dense green clusters of flower buds at the ends of the central axis and the branches. </p><p>If left unharvested, those buds bear yellow flowers with four petals and produce silique fruits (a dry capsule). </p><p>Broccoli thrives in moderate to cool climates and is propagated by seeds, either sown directly in the field or in plant beds to produce transplants. </p><p>The heads, or florets, reach harvest in 60 to 150 days, depending upon the variety and the weather.</p><p>Combined in 2017, China and India produced 73% of the world's broccoli and cauliflower crops.</p><p>Broccoli resulted from breeding of cultivated Brassica crops in the northern Mediterranean starting in about the sixth century BC.</p><p>Since the time of the Roman Empire, broccoli has been commonly consumed, and is eaten raw or cooked.</p><p>Native to the eastern Mediterranean and Asia Minor, sprouting broccoli was cultivated in Italy in ancient Roman times and was introduced to England and America in the 1700s.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/brassica-oleracea-italica/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/vegetables/brassica-oleracea-italica/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/brassica-oleracea-italica/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/vegetables/brassica-oleracea-italica/contextual.jpg","caption":"<p>Broccoli
